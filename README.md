### Hi!

Currently working on 

- My study of Electronic Engineering at University of Bath
- Making various game engine prototypes in my spare time for fun, some of which I upload here!
- Learning to collaborate with code better
- Some video game modding, namely Super Smash Bros Ultimate

My programming took a backseat in my life last year as I focussed on my studies more and set up my own custom controller modding business, however this year I plan to pick it back up, mainly in Python.
